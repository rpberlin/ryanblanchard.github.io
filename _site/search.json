      "description" : "Using XFOIL to bridge the gap between airfoil geometry and aerodynamic performance at low Reynolds number.",
      "content"     : "Why XFOIL MattersDesigning a wing always starts with the same uncomfortable gap: You can draw a beautiful airfoil shape — but how do you know what it does aerodynamically?For conventional aircraft, that gap is often bridged with wind-tunnel data, empirical charts, or CFD. For small UAVs and human-powered aircraft, those options are either too expensive or too slow to iterate.XFOIL, written in Fortran at MIT by Mark Drela mit.edu/drela/xfoil, sits precisely in that gap. It provides a fast, physics-based way to go from geometry to aerodynamic coefficients — lift, drag, and moment — as a function of angle of attack and Reynolds number. That makes it an indispensable tool for early-stage wing design, especially when iteration speed matters.For my pedal-powered aircraft project, XFOIL is the first link in the chain connecting a 2D airfoil sketch to a full 3D wing and, eventually, to a flyable machine. Paying the up front price for getting old Fortran to compile on Apple silicon with a series of python wrappers around it for automation has paid huge dividends for speeding up my analysis cycles.The Low Reynolds Number RealityOne key reason XFOIL is so central to my workflow is that I operate in a very different aerodynamic regime than most airplanes.The Reynolds number is defined as:$$\\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{\\rho U c}{\\mu}$$where: $ \\rho $ is air density $ U $ is freestream velocity $ c $ is the characteristic length (airfoil chord) $ \\mu $ is dynamic viscosityLarge transport aircraft operate at Reynolds numbers on the order of $10^7$–$10^8$. In contrast, small UAVs and human-powered aircraft often live in the range:$$\\mathrm{Re} \\sim 10^5 \\text{ to } 10^6$$At these low Reynolds numbers: Laminar boundary layers dominate Separation bubbles are common Small geometry changes can have large aerodynamic consequencesXFOIL’s coupled inviscid panel method + boundary-layer solver is specifically designed to capture these effects efficiently.From Geometry to Aerodynamic CoefficientsGiven an airfoil shape, XFOIL solves for the pressure distribution and boundary-layer state around the perimeter, producing integrated aerodynamic coefficients: Lift coefficient $C_l$ Drag coefficient $C_d$ Moment coefficient $C_m$XFOIL solution showing pressure coefficient and boundary-layer state around the airfoil, along with resulting aerodynamic coefficients.The lift coefficient is defined as:$$C_l = \\frac{L}{\\tfrac{1}{2} \\rho U^2 S}$$This normalization allows results to be compared across scales, speeds, and densities — critical when extrapolating between test cases.XFOIL allows these coefficients to be computed across: Angle of attack sweeps Reynolds number sweeps Different boundary-layer transition assumptionsThat makes it ideal for mapping the operating envelope of an airfoil before committing to a wing design.Circulation: The Quantity That Really MattersWhile lift coefficients are convenient, the deeper physical quantity behind lift is circulation.For a 2D airfoil, lift per unit span is related to circulation $ \\Gamma $ via the Kutta–Joukowski theorem:$$L' = \\rho U \\Gamma$$Circulation provides a direct link between: Pressure distribution Vorticity in the flow Lift generationThis becomes especially important when moving from 2D airfoils to 3D wings, where the spanwise distribution of circulation determines induced drag and overall efficiency.XFOIL provides the sectional lift data needed to build that circulation distribution across a wing.From 2D Airfoils to a 3D WingA real wing is not a single airfoil — it is a spanwise distribution of airfoil sections, chord lengths, and twist angles.For my designs, I use XFOIL to: Analyze candidate airfoils at local Reynolds numbers Select sections that perform well across the expected lift range Assign twist to shape the spanwise lift distributionPlanform layout showing spanwise airfoil sections and geometric twist distribution.The goal is simple in principle: Maximize lift for a given power Minimize drag, especially induced drag Maintain gentle stall behaviorInduced Drag and Lift DistributionFor a finite wing, induced drag arises from trailing vortices and depends on how lift is distributed along the span.In coefficient form, induced drag can be written as:$$C_{D_i} = \\frac{C_L^2}{\\pi e \\, \\mathrm{AR}}$$where: $ C_L $ is the wing lift coefficient $ \\mathrm{AR} $ is aspect ratio $ e $ is the span efficiency factorThe efficiency factor $e$ encodes how close the actual lift distribution is to the ideal elliptical case. $$ \\Gamma(\\theta)=2 b U_\\infty \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin(n\\theta), \\qquad y=\\frac{b}{2}\\cos\\theta,\\ \\theta\\in[0,\\pi] $$ then the induced drag factor comes out: $$ e=\\frac{1}{1+\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} n\\left(\\frac{A_n}{A_1}\\right)^2} $$ $$ C_L=\\pi\\,AR\\,A_1, \\qquad C_{D_i}=\\pi\\,AR\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n A_n^2 $$ By shaping the spanwise circulation — through twist, taper, and airfoil selection — induced drag can be reduced significantly. XFOIL provides the sectional data needed to make those design decisions quantitatively rather than by intuition alone.Why This Workflow WorksXFOIL is not a replacement for CFD or experiments. Instead, it plays a very specific and valuable role: It is fast enough for design iteration It captures key low-Reynolds-number physics It produces interpretable aerodynamic quantities It enables informed 3D wing design before expensive analysisFor both my UAV work and my human-powered aircraft project, XFOIL is the tool that lets me move confidently from a sketch of an airfoil to a wing that has a realistic chance of working in the real world.Everything downstream — lifting-line models, BEM codes, CFD, and eventually flight testing — depends on getting this first step right."

      "description" : "Designing, building, and validating an afterburner flameholder experiment using LES and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition.",
      "content"     : "Why Afterburners Are HardAfterburners live in a difficult corner of fluid mechanics: high-speed turbulent flow, intense heat release, strong recirculation, and unsteady pressure coupling. A flameholder has to do two contradictory things at once: Create a stable recirculation zone to anchor a flame Do as little damage as possible to pressure recovery and thrustFor vee-gutter bluff-body flameholders, stability comes from the wake. Hot combustion products recirculate behind the gutter, ignite incoming reactants, and sustain a flame even when residence times are extremely short. The same wake, however, is inherently unsteady and sheds vortices that can couple to acoustics and lead to thermoacoustic instabilities.Understanding how that wake behaves — and whether simulations reproduce it for the right reasons — was the central motivation of my PhD.What My Thesis Set Out to DoMost combustion simulations are “validated” using time-averaged quantities: mean velocities, RMS fluctuations, or single-point spectra. Those metrics are necessary, but they are not sufficient for unsteady reacting flows.This work asked a more demanding question: Can we validate simulations based on the structure and dynamics of the dominant flow and heat-release modes?To answer that, I designed and built a dedicated afterburner-scale experiment and paired it with Large Eddy Simulations (LES). Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) was then used as the common language between experiment and computation.The Experimental RigThe experimental setup was built from scratch in the Combustion Systems Dynamics Lab at Virginia Tech. It consisted of: A modular fuel-injection section A long converging section to control boundary-layer development A rectangular test section with optical access A 70° vee-gutter flameholder spanning the ductHigh-speed diagnostics included: Stereo Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) for velocity fields Filtered chemiluminescence imaging as a proxy for heat releaseThe rig was designed to operate in both non-reacting (cold-flow) and reacting regimes, allowing a controlled progression from pure fluid mechanics to fully coupled combustion dynamics.Large Eddy SimulationOn the computational side, LES models were developed in both ANSYS Fluent and OpenFOAM, matched as closely as possible to the experiment.At the heart of LES is a spatial filtering of the Navier–Stokes equations:$$\\frac{\\partial \\bar{\\rho}}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\bar{\\rho} \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}) = 0$$$$\\frac{\\partial \\bar{\\rho} \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\bar{\\rho} \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}} \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}) = -\\nabla \\bar{p} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\bar{\\tau} + \\tau_{\\text{sgs}})$$Unresolved turbulence was modeled using dynamic Smagorinsky-type closures, with grid resolution chosen so that the majority of turbulent kinetic energy was resolved rather than modeled.A key validation criterion was the Pope criterion, ensuring that modeled subgrid energy remained a small fraction of the resolved energy:$$M = \\frac{k_{\\text{sgs}}}{k_{\\text{resolved}}} \\lesssim 0.2$$Instantaneous LES velocity magnitude showing alternating vortex sheddingProper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)POD provided the bridge between experiment and simulation.Given a set of instantaneous snapshots assembled into a data matrix $ \\mathbf{U} $, POD seeks a low-dimensional representation:$$\\mathbf{U} \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^N a_i(t) \\, \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_i(\\mathbf{x})$$ where: $ \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_i $ are spatial modes $ a_i(t) $ are temporal coefficients Each mode represents a coherent physical structure Crucially, POD is agnostic to data source. Experimental measurements and LES fields can be decomposed and compared mode-by-mode.Cold Flow: Wake DynamicsIn the non-reacting case, POD isolated the dominant vortex-shedding mode of the vee-gutter wake. The shedding frequency collapsed to a Strouhal number of approximately:$$\\mathrm{St} = \\frac{f w}{U} \\approx 0.24$$The first POD modes from PIV, Fluent, and OpenFOAM showed strong agreement in: Spatial structure Amplitude Streamwise evolutionThis went well beyond matching mean velocity profiles and demonstrated that the simulations were capturing the right physics of the wake.POD modes of the cold flow PIV data (top row) and CFD simulations (Fluent middle OpenFOAM bottom)Reacting Flow: Heat Release DynamicsFor reacting cases, validation became more subtle. Chemiluminescence measurements are line-of-sight integrals, while LES produces local volumetric heat release.To make the comparison meaningful, the LES heat release was integrated numerically along synthetic lines of sight:Instantaneous heat flame sheet left with integrated heat release “image” on the leftfig4-flameprojection.png$$I(x,y) = \\int \\dot{q}^{'''}(x,y,z) \\, dz$$ Your browser does not support the video tag.Animation of the simulated flame (left) and the integrated heat release image $I(x,y)$ on the rightPOD of these integrated fields revealed: A dominant symmetric shedding mode Higher-frequency harmonic modes A low-frequency, low-energy mode invisible to time-averaged analysisThe agreement in mode shape, frequency, and relative energy between experiment and LES provided strong evidence that the simulations were dynamically faithful.POD modes of the heat release chemiluminescence data (left) and CFD simulation in Fluent (right)Why This MattersThe most important outcome of this work was methodological.By validating dynamic modes, not just statistics, we gain confidence that LES models can be trusted to explore: Confinement effects Boundary condition sensitivity Transitions between symmetric and asymmetric flame dynamicsThis is essential for predicting combustion instability risk, flameholder performance, and operability limits in real engines.So What?My PhD sat deliberately at the intersection of design, experiment, simulation, and data-driven analysis. Building the hardware mattered. Writing the solvers mattered. But the real leverage came from learning how to ask better validation questions.That mindset — validating structure, not just numbers — continues to shape how I approach complex engineering problems today."

      "description" : "Closing the loop from airfoil geometry to thrust, torque, and power using XFOIL, QPROP, and Python-driven optimization.",
      "content"     : "Why Propeller Design Is HardA propeller is just a rotating wing — but that simple statement hides a lot of complexity.Unlike a fixed wing, every blade section on a propeller: Sees a different relative velocity Operates at a different effective angle of attack Contributes simultaneously to thrust and torqueDesigning a propeller therefore requires closing a loop between: 2D airfoil performance 3D blade geometry Integral thrust, torque, and powerThis is where XFOIL and QPROP come in. XFOIL provides the sectional aerodynamics. QPROP integrates those sections into a rotating blade model and predicts the global performance.Together, they form a fast, physics-based path from geometry → performance, which is exactly what I needed for UAV and human-powered aircraft propellers.Theoretical Background (QPROP in a Nutshell)QPROP is based on blade-element / momentum theory with careful accounting of velocities and induced effects. A blade element at radius $r$ sees a relative velocity composed of axial and tangential components:Velocity components and force decomposition used in QPROP blade-element theoryThe local relative velocity magnitude is:$$W = \\sqrt{(V_a + u_a)^2 + (\\Omega r - u_t)^2}$$where: $V_a$ is axial inflow velocity $\\Omega r$ is tangential blade speed $u_a, u_t$ are induced axial and tangential velocitiesThe blade section angle of attack depends directly on the local twist angle $\\beta(r)$ and the inflow angle $\\phi$:$$\\alpha(r) = \\beta(r) - \\phi(r)$$This immediately explains why twist matters, even for propellers optimized for static thrust: each radius experiences a different inflow direction, and without twist, most of the blade would operate far from its optimal lift condition.Thrust, Torque, and PowerFor a blade element of chord $c(r)$, the differential thrust and torque are:$$dT = \\tfrac{1}{2} \\rho W^2 c \\left( C_l \\cos\\phi - C_d \\sin\\phi \\right) dr$$$$dQ = r \\, \\tfrac{1}{2} \\rho W^2 c \\left( C_l \\sin\\phi + C_d \\cos\\phi \\right) dr$$Integrating along the blade yields total thrust $T$ and torque $Q$, with power given by:$$P = Q \\, \\Omega$$Even in static thrust conditions ($V_a = 0$), the blade experiences a strong radial variation in inflow angle. A propeller optimized for static thrust still requires careful twist design to keep each section near its peak $C_l/C_d$.Nomenclature (Following QPROP)Using the notation from Drela’s formulation: $W$ — Relative velocity magnitude $V_a$ — Axial inflow velocity $\\Omega r$ — Tangential blade speed $u_a, u_t$ — Induced velocities $\\phi$ — Inflow angle $\\beta$ — Blade pitch (twist) angle $\\alpha$ — Section angle of attack $C_l, C_d$ — Sectional lift and drag coefficientsA full derivation is available in the original QPROP theory document:QPROP Theory PDFQPROP itself is written and maintained by Mark Drela, whose tools have quietly shaped decades of practical aerodynamic design:web.mit.edu/drela/qpropFeeding XFOIL into QPROPQPROP does not invent airfoil aerodynamics — it consumes them.For each blade section: XFOIL is used to generate polars $(C_l, C_d, C_m)$ These are fitted with quadratic functions of $C_l = f(C_d)$ QPROP uses those curve fits plus Reynolds Number and Prandtl-Glauert to predict local airfoil performanceSo the workflow can capture the relevant physics: Airfoil choice Reynolds number range Compressibility effects at elevate local Mach Number Transition modeling assumptionsAt the low Reynolds numbers relevant for small UAVs and human-powered aircraft, this coupling matters enormously.Python Automation and OptimizationWhile QPROP is fast, running it manually is not how you design a propeller.I built a Python wrapper around QPROP that: Generates candidate blade geometries (chord and twist parameterizations) Calls QPROP programmatically Parses thrust, torque, and power outputs Feeds results into an optimizerThis allowed me to optimize directly for objectives like: Maximum static thrust at fixed power Thrust-to-torque ratio Sensitivity to RPM variationsGetting this working reliably took nontrivial effort: Compiling legacy Fortran on macOS Dealing with compiler quirks and I/O formatting Making the wrapper robust to failed convergence cases Experimenting with different optimization algorithmsIt was worth it. Once automated, design iteration became fast and quantitative instead of trial-and-error.From Optimized Geometry to CADThe final step was turning optimized blade distributions into real hardware.The propeller was parameterized such that: Each blade could be split into two printable segments A central hub could be printed separately All parts could be bonded or mechanically joinedThis drove constraints back into the optimization: Minimum chord for structural integrity Twist smoothness for manufacturability Hub-root geometry compatibilityPropeller drawn in CAD using OnShapeThe result was a propeller that: Matches the optimized aerodynamic geometry Can be manufactured with desktop tools Is suitable for static testing and iteration3D-printed propeller assembled from a central hub and two segments per blade.Why This Workflow MattersThis XFOIL → QPROP → Python → CAD pipeline closes the loop from theory to hardware.It allows: Fast iteration at the concept stage Quantitative trade studies Direct connection between aerodynamic assumptions and measured performanceMost importantly, it avoids over-investing in high-fidelity CFD before the fundamental design space has been explored.For small aircraft, that leverage is everything.Closing ThoughtsXFOIL and QPROP are not flashy tools. They are not new. But they encode decades of aerodynamic insight in a form that rewards careful thinking.Used together — and automated properly — they form a design workflow that is fast, transparent, and grounded in physics. That combination is rare, and it’s why they remain central to how I design propellers today."

      "description" : "A lifelong idea, finally approached with real engineering tools.",
      "content"     : "A Childhood Idea That Never Went AwaySome engineering projects start with a problem statement.This one started with a PBS documentary.I was a kid when I first saw a program about the Daedalus Project, the human-powered aircraft that successfully flew from Crete to Santorini. I don’t remember all the details, but I do remember what it did to my imagination. Suddenly, flying didn’t feel like something reserved for jet engines and control towers — it felt almost personal. Human. Attainable.Not long after, I started sketching designs for a human-powered helicopter that my friends and I could pedal up into the nearby mountains for a camping trip. Needless to say, the physics were… optimistic.Around the same time, a PBS science show flashed an equation on the screen:$$F_L = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\rho U^2 C_L A$$I remember scrambling to find out when the episode would re-air so I could be ready with pen and paper. I copied it down, stared at it, and immediately realized I was in way over my head. I didn’t know what density was. I definitely didn’t know how anyone could possibly determine $C_L$.But that equation stuck.Coming Back With Better ToolsDecades later, that same equation still sits at the heart of this project — but now it’s surrounded by tools I didn’t have back then.Designing a human-powered aircraft is a brutally constrained problem: Very low available power (on the order of 200–300 W sustained) Very low flight speeds Extremely low Reynolds numbers Severe mass and structural constraintsEvery design decision is coupled. Wing area drives drag. Drag drives power. Power caps speed. Speed feeds directly back into lift.The basic lift requirement is still simple:$$L = W$$But achieving that lift efficiently at walking-to-jogging speeds is anything but.This project is where all of the threads from earlier posts come together:airfoil analysis with XFOIL, wing design and induced drag management, propeller optimization for static and low-speed thrust, and an unapologetically iterative design-build mindset.The ConfigurationThe current concept is a tractor configuration with: A very high aspect ratio wing Carefully managed twist distribution A lightweight fuselage nacelle just large enough for the pilot and drivetrain A propeller optimized specifically for low-speed efficiencyThe aircraft is designed around the pilot, not the other way around. The seating position, drivetrain geometry, and center of gravity placement are all chosen to minimize trim drag and structural penalties.Isometric CAD rendering showing overall configuration and pilot integrationDesigning for Low Reynolds Number FlightAt the speeds a human can realistically sustain, Reynolds numbers are typically an order of magnitude lower than conventional aircraft. That changes everything:$$\\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{\\rho U c}{\\mu}$$At low Reynolds numbers: Laminar separation becomes a dominant concern Small changes in airfoil geometry have outsized effects Empirical intuition from conventional aircraft breaks downThis is why tools like XFOIL are indispensable. They allow me to go from geometry to aerodynamic performance and close the loop between concept and reality.But airfoils are only half the story.Wing Planform and Structural RealityThe wing planform is driven by two competing goals: Minimize induced drag through a near-elliptical lift distribution Maintain a structure that can actually be built and carriedTwist is used aggressively to shape the spanwise loading while keeping root bending moments manageable. The wing is broken into discrete sections that balance aerodynamic idealism with structural pragmatism.Front view highlighting extreme aspect ratio and spanwise twistTop view showing planform, control surfaces, and wing segmentationWhy This Project Matters (to Me)This isn’t about breaking records or chasing headlines.It’s about finally revisiting an idea that’s been quietly present for most of my life — but doing it with the right tools, the right physics, and the right level of respect for how hard the problem actually is.Every part of this aircraft exists because of something I once struggled to understand: That mysterious lift equation Why drag matters more than you think Why efficiency is a system-level property Why building hardware teaches you things simulations never willThis project sits at the intersection of curiosity, discipline, and persistence — and for me, that’s where the most meaningful engineering lives.There’s still a long way to go. But for the first time, this isn’t a sketch in a notebook.It’s an airplane."

      "description" : "How building a Formula SAE car from nothing shaped how I think about engineering, design, and learning by doing.",
      "content"     : "What Formula SAE IsFormula SAE is a student engineering competition where teams design, build, and race a small, open-wheel formula-style car. On paper it’s a motorsports competition. In reality, it’s one of the most intense systems-engineering learning environments you can experience as an undergraduate.Teams are judged not just on lap time, but on: Engineering design Manufacturing quality Cost and business case Reliability and executionThe final carMost established teams iterate year-to-year, refining designs using previous cars as testbeds. That luxury mattered a lot to us — because we didn’t have it.One F1 Obsession and One Physics BrainThe project started with a friend of mine who was, in the best possible way, an F1 obsessive. He didn’t just watch Formula 1 — he lived it. Telemetry, suspension geometry, aero trade studies, team politics. All of it.I came from a different angle. I loved the physics: fluid flow, dynamics, structures, control. Formula SAE immediately struck me as the ultimate forcing function — a way to turn abstract coursework into something brutally real.Together, we convinced our university to approve Formula SAE as a senior capstone project. That approval came with a modest budget and, more importantly, legitimacy. By the end, about 20 undergraduate students were involved in designing, building, testing, and driving the car.A Lens for LearningI easily spent twice as much time on Formula SAE as on all my coursework combined — and it paid off in ways no class ever could.Every new concept suddenly mattered: Fluid flow → intake and cooling System dynamics → suspension and driveline CAD → everything Design for manufacturing → everything again Kinematics → suspension geometry Instrumentation → testing and debugging Statistics → data interpretation FEA and CFD → structural and aero intuition Optimization → tradeoffs everywhereFormula SAE gave me a lens. Instead of learning topics in isolation, every lecture felt like it could help make a better race car.CAD First, Simulation Later (If Ever)We realized very quickly that CAD was non-negotiable. Everything had to fit. Everything interacted. Everything had consequences.The car’s structure was designed entirely by students, balancing stiffness, mass, manufacturability, and safety.Early CAD rendering of the Formula SAE car, showing chassis layout, suspension geometry, and packaging constraintsRefined CAD model incorporating lessons learned from the prototype build and early testingWe used finite element analysis selectively — not to chase perfect stress predictions, but to identify load paths, calculate stiffnesses, and filter out bad design concepts.Finite element analysis of critical subframe sections used to guide structural reinforcement and weight reductionSimulation was a guide, not a crutch.What we couldn’t do — at least not well — was simulate the full system. About 90% of the teams we competed against had previous cars to validate models against. We had nothing.So we made a counterintuitive decision.Two Cars, Not OneInstead of betting everything on a single “perfect” design, we committed to building two cars. A rough prototype car A refined final competition carWe started in September and set an aggressive internal deadline: The first car would drive under its own power by January 1.We missed that deadline by three days — but on January 4, the prototype rolled under its own power. Your browser does not support the video tag.Well, more than rolledThat moment changed everything. Suddenly we had: A testbed Real data Real failures Real intuitionEverything we learned went directly into the final car.Driving the ThingI only drove the car once.It was… violent. 0–100 km/h in about 3 seconds More than 1 g lateral acceleration The driver wasn’t so much sitting as lying down to keep the center of gravity low My shoulders were a few centimeters from the exhaust headersThey were red for days afterward.It was raw, loud, uncomfortable, and absolutely unforgettable.Results and TrajectoriesThat year, we won Formula SAE Rookie of the Year.But the bigger outcome was personal trajectory. My friend went on to work for several F1 teams over the years (another story for another day) I went to graduate school to learn combustion and how to design real experimentsFor me, Formula SAE permanently set the direction: taking ideas from my head,turning them into models and mockups,and then building hardware that actually worksWhy It Still MattersThat project taught me something I still rely on today: You don’t learn engineering by avoiding complexity.You learn it by confronting complexity early, imperfectly, and honestly.Formula SAE wasn’t just a car.It was the moment engineering stopped being theoretical for me — and started being real."

      "description" : "An autonomous robot, a graduate-level course, and my first real encounter with feedback control.",
      "content"     : "A Graduate Course Disguised as a Trial by FireAs an undergraduate, my university allowed students to take up to three graduate-level courses as electives. For my first, I chose Mechatronics — partly because it sounded intimidating, and partly because I suspected it would force me to learn things I didn’t yet know I needed.The course itself was largely conceptual. The real grade came from a semester-long group project: build an autonomous robot capable of navigating a complex course and completing a multi-object task under uncertainty.I was grouped with two PhD students. Both were racing to finish and defend their dissertations that same semester.Which meant — very quickly — that a large fraction of the project landed on me.The final product of much sweat and many tears - “the Turtle”The Challenge: Turtle’s WorldThe robot (eventually named Turtle) had to autonomously navigate a course featuring: Ramps and uneven terrain A bridge with transparent decking Multicolored walls and boundary regions A “soccer goal” Multiple multicolored ping pong balls, only some of which were valid targetsPoints were awarded for: Completing the full course Capturing the correct color balls Returning them to the goalPoints were deducted for grabbing the wrong balls.No teleoperation. No resets.The Hardware We Had (and Didn’t)Our available hardware was minimal and unforgiving: A few DC motors and servo motors A CMUcam (RS-232 color vision camera) An ultrasonic rangefinder An embedded controller with limited ADC and PWM Batteries, wires, and lots of LEGO Whatever mechanical parts we could scroungeNo encoders. No IMU. No real odometry.Just enough rope to hang ourselves.Team Roles (and Reality)Despite the pressure, the team dynamic worked remarkably well: One teammate was strong in software One was skilled with electronics I became: Mechanical designer Systems integrator Algorithm developer I also became the person who had to decide which ambitious ideas to kill early.Because it became clear very quickly:Even with years, this problem would be hard.We had months.Mistakes (So Many Mistakes)We made nearly every mistake you can make on a first autonomous system: Trusted open-loop wheel control far too long Assumed the CMUcam’s color thresholds wouldn’t drift when someone opened a window Mounted batteries so high that we lost traction on steep ramps Tried to do “precision” navigation with no real state estimation Underestimated how fast perception degrades as speed increasesEvery subsystem interfered with every other subsystem.Raising the camera improved visibility but raised the center of gravity.Driving faster improved coverage but destroyed perception reliability.Adding batteries improved run time but made ramps impossible.It was systems engineering, whether we liked it or not.The Night Everything ChangedAbout halfway through the semester, I was alone in the lab one evening, staring at camera data and motor commands, when something clicked.We didn’t need precision.We needed feedback.Using the CMUcam, we could compute the horizontal offset of a ball’s image centroid from the center of the camera’s field of view. That offset could be treated as an error signal.So I implemented a simple P-controller:$$e = x_{\\text{ball}} - x_{\\text{center}}$$$$\\omega_L = \\omega_0 - K_p e$$$$\\omega_R = \\omega_0 + K_p e$$That was it. No integral. No derivative. Just proportional feedback.The robot homed in on the ball.Once the image centroid dropped low enough in the frame (meaning the ball was close), we switched to open-loop forward motion and trapped the ball between the front wheels.It worked.The feeling when it worked the first time — and when I showed it to my teammates the next day and it worked again — was unforgettable.That was the moment feedback control stopped being math and became behavior.Iterating the Design - the Mouse and the BrickWe went through three major design phases over the semester, each one informed by painful lessons from the previous.First design iteration: ambitious, unstable, and far too optimistic, “the Mouse”Second iteration: lower center of gravity, improved camera placement, and simplified mechanisms, lovingly referred to as “the Brick”Each iteration stripped away complexity and increased robustness.By the end of the semester, our robot was the only one that could reliably navigate the course — and the only one that could capture balls.The Almost-Perfect RunWe completed the course.We captured all the balls.But we missed a perfect score.We never had time to implement a proper ball ejector. Instead, we relied on a servo-actuated flap and an open-loop “charge the goal and brake” maneuver.The balls got stuck on the chassis.So close.Only afterward did the professor admit that this was the fourth year he had taught the course that way — and that no team had ever completed the full challenge.Why Turtle Still Matters to MeThis project cost me an enormous amount of time. Easily more than all my other coursework combined that semester.And it was absolutely worth it.It taught me: That feedback beats precision That hardware lies That perception and control are inseparable That simple equations can produce lifelike behavior That open-ended problems are where real learning happensMost importantly, it set my trajectory.This was the first time I took something messy, underdefined, and borderline impossible — and made it work through iteration, physics, and stubbornness.Turtle didn’t just navigate a course.It taught me how to engineer."
